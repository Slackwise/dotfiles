My dotfiles
===========

These are really more for glancing rather than forking. Beware my crazy
customizations.


bin
---
A directory I add to my `$PATH` on unix-y machines.


binw
----
Same as `bin`, but only added on Windows machines.


lib
---
Various minor libraries I use for customization. These aren't _real_ libraries.


vim
---
My vim config and setup scripts, so I can just hit the ground running on any
machine.


zsh
---
My zsh config and other scripts that customize zsh.


tmux
----
My tmux config, and anything else related.
