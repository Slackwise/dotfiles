My dotfiles
===========
These are really more for glancing rather than forking. Beware
my crazy customizations.


bin
---
A directory I add to my `$PATH` on unix-y machines.


binw
----
Same as `bin`, but only added on Windows machines.


lib
---
Various minor libraries I use for customization. These aren't
_real_ libraries.


other dirs
----------
All other directories are named after applications and contain
setup and config scripts for said applications. If they're
actual dotfiles, then they're written sans the dot and symlinked
to `$HOME` via setup scripts.
